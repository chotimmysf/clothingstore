<b>BACKSTORY</b>

This project was inspired by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/sass-the-complete-sass-course-css-preprocessor/learn/lecture/13474292#overview">this SASS Udemy Course.</a>
The web app represents a mock high-end French retailer's website, which incorporates CSS grid elements.

<b>PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS</b>

In addition to learning how CSS grid elements worked, I also learned that the @function element in SCSS can be used to apply specific sizes and colors to many different sections of my web app. For instance, I used a color function to color the web app's text, backgrounds, and buttons.

<b>APP OVERVIEW</b>

1. <i>Departments Slideshow:</i>Features 6 different departments of the store, with each department representing a French brand.

2. <i>Featured Products:</i>Three featured products, with links for instant purchases of the items.

3. <i>Newsletter Subscriptions:</i> Simple input boxes for collecting information for the retailer's newsletter, with a "Subscribe" button to submit info written in the input boxes. <i>Note: Submissions are NOT actually recorded</i>

<b>TECHNOLOGIES USED</b>

<i>CSS Grid Elements</i>

<b>CHALLENGES</b>

<i>Debugging "Gift Ideas" Dropdown:</i>When adding the slideshow to the web app, a dropdown menu that filters products by price was supposed to be seen when hovering on "Gift Ideas". Re-checking my code and editing it did not resolve the issue.

<i>Debugging Products Buttons:</i> These "buttons" have not been styled at all, even though code for the buttons had been written.
